                 I always like to learn different and new things about the people who are living other countries, having different values, religion, ideology and cultures. In order to achieve it I started to learn different languages. Because I believe that knowing language is the main key for me to get into these different worlds. Therefore, learning new languages is my biggest passion. Apart from it, my biggest hobby is football. I always watch the games and follow leagues.
              </p>
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                I have couple experiences as Translator and Interpreter. I`ve worked as English interpreter in couple of sport clubs. I`ve worked in Kayserispor FC for 20 days. I just join the camp before second half of Turkish League and did lots of translation (consecutive, simultaneous, whispering etc…).After that experience, I started to work as an Intern Interpreter in  Besiktas JK which is one of the biggest sport club in Turkey. I did lots of translations for Turkish Football Magazines. I joined couple of UEFA Europa League`s press conferences. Furthermore, I prepared lots writings and translations about law, fiction etc…

<p>INTERESTS
New Languages:
I really like to learn new languages and meeting different people from different cultures. I believe it is the only option to apply if somebody wants to make their life more colourful and enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
Football:
As Turkish person I always have big interest about football. I think Football is not just a sport that you can do to be health, I think Football is a culture which shape people`s lives.
</p>
<p>
Films and Books:
As Translator I have to improve myself in every aspect. Therefore, I watch lots of movies and read books. From my perspective understating a culture is not only knowing the language but also learning values, beliefs and way of living.  Literature brings all these things to us.
